# Bolt Project

A Bolt Project represents a fully functional application capable of running on any system. It encompasses a wide range of possibilities, including applications developed using popular frameworks and technologies such as NextJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Laravel PHP, or Golang.
Additionally, it can also encompass a monorepo containing multiple microservices, providing a flexible and scalable architecture for complex projects.
